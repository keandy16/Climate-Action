# Climate-Action

The purpose of this Shiny app is to create a quiz that matches users with the best-fit climate action based on their personal preferences. The app will contain a 
introduction page where we explain how to use our app and a second page containing an interactive map that will find climate actions for users.

The most basic version of the app can be found in the 'app5.R' page. This has all filter options displayed at once. You will also need to have the 'www' and 'Data' folders downloaded in your workspace. 

'app8.R' has a functional ui, but not a functional server. The UI is reactive, but I was not able to figure out how to create a functional output in the map.

'app9.R' is a slightly simplified version of 'app8.R' in that it is not reactive and there are fewer filter options, but it works! This is the R script I used to make the promotional video.
