# Climate-Action

The purpose of this Shiny app is to create a quiz that matches users with the best-fit climate action based on their personal preferences. The app will contain a 
introduction page where we explain how to use our app and a second page containing an interactive map that will find climate actions for users.

The app can be found in the 'app5.R' page. You will also need to have the 'www' and 'Data' folders downloaded in your workspace.
